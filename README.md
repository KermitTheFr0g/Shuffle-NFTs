# NFT Shuffler

## About the project
This project is a simple script to shuffle your NFTs. If there was any reason that you wanted to change the order of your collection, or even if you wanted to insert rare 1 of 1 NFTs into the collection this script can be used. Along with shuffling the NFTs it is possible to change the name, description and base URI inside of the meta data.

## Getting started 
It is very simple to get started. All the user needs to do is have unique names for all of their NFTs and make sure that the NFT image and the corresponding JSON share the same name. Have a folder containing both of these and you will be ready.

### Installation
Here I am going to show you how to setup the NFT Shuffler for use.
1. Clone the project
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/KermitTheFr0g/shuffle-nfts.git 
```
2. Installing all of the NPM packagaes is the first step.
```sh
$ npm install
```

### Prerequisites
If the two folders `images` and `jsons` are not already in your project create both of these using the command.
```
$ mkdir {images, jsons}
```
Now place all of the NFT images into the `images` folder and then place all of the metadata into the `jsons` folder.
